# Hi there 👋
- I'll update this thing later 😄
- Why are there HTML comments in this file/readme.md?

- ohh.... so this is like the pinned post on your profile. And everytime you want to update/edit it you have to get into this readme file. Starting to make some sense. Learned about commit&pull
- finished the GitHub Intro, time to make a simple portfolio and start building stuff.
- This was edited in VSC 🤔
- This aswell 👍
